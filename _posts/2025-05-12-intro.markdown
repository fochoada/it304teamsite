&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses technologies that enable machines to perform tasks traditionally associated with human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, generating images, and making decisions. One of the most transformative advancements in this field is generative AI, which allows systems to produce original content—ranging from text and audio to images and video—by learning patterns from vast datasets. Technologies such as ChatGPT, DALL·E, and other large language and diffusion models are key examples of this shift.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace at which generative AI is evolving presents both vast potential and growing concern. As noted by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (2024), generative AI is expected to redefine entire industries by enhancing productivity, reducing operational costs, and driving innovation. At the same time, its capacity to create convincing synthetic media raises urgent questions around authenticity, trust, and social harm. With applications ranging from voice cloning to automated video generation, these tools challenge conventional understandings of authorship, privacy, and truth.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We chose to focus on generative AI because of its immediate and far-reaching implications for society and governance. For policymakers, the stakes are particularly high. Generative AI is not only accelerating change in the private sector, but it is also influencing public discourse, labor markets, and information integrity. Qualcomm (2024) highlights a timeline of rapid breakthroughs that demonstrate just how quickly these technologies are evolving—from the launch of GPT models to real-time voice replication tools. This accelerated development outpaces current policy responses, revealing the urgent need for regulatory frameworks that can keep pace with innovation.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding generative AI is critical for crafting informed, ethical, and forward-looking policies. The technology's capacity to empower as well as disrupt makes it one of the defining challenges of our time.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout history, Artificial Intelligence(AI) has been defined in various ways, focusing on its features and technological advancements. Kurzweil (1990) mentioned that AI is the art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people, whereas Nilsson (1998) noted that AI is concerned with intelligent behavior in artifacts. These different approaches were differentiated as one group believed AI is a system that acts like a human. In contrast, another group believed AI is a system that combines both mathematics and engineering(Russell, S., & Norvig, P., 2003). However, today, we can see that both perspectives have been integrated to discover new AI-based technical advancements called Generative AI. Generative AI is an AI system that learns patterns from large datasets and creates an original output based on the learning. The primary applications of generative AI are AI image generation technology, such as Dall-E, Midjourney, and AI voice-replication technology, such as Resemble.AI and VocaliD. These real-world applications depict how AI continued to evolve into a powerful tool – both a boon and a curse, in reshaping human creativity and intelligence.
