  <span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">Ethical Concerns</span>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generative Artificial Intelligence’s ability to create, recreate, and replicate images, viewable media, and speech synthesis (synthetic media) poses significant risks as well as social and political concerns. Due to generative Artificial Intelligence being able to create deepfakes of and recreate the voices of other people through speech synthesis, it can lead to a much larger wide spread of misinformation and disinformation in all sectors, especially for politics and governments; lead to the loss of human led jobs, such as acting, advertising, etc.; and lead to bigger accounts of identity theft and misrepresentation of people. Furthermore, the technology’s ability to replicate and create synthetic media based on off what it was “trained” on poses the potential and possibility of challenging current ethics related to copyright and plagiarism laws.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of generative Artificial Intelligence has its own set of positives and negatives from an ethical standpoint. For example, the use of this technology to create synthetic media with the intent to spread harm is morally wrong as it can cause serious harm to a person’s self-image, reputation, position in society. But the use of the technology for synthetic media can be used to quickly send out important messages, such as a health warning for a new disease going around in country that the people should know about, or it can be used aid those with those with a vocal disability.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use the technology to replace current jobs is another example that brings up the ethics of this technology in question.  Synthetic media has the ability to replace jobs in areas such as acting, filmmaking, advertising, and more. If companies start to use artificial intelligence as recommendation to create media, it is probable that they would replace the people hired to create media which leads to a loss in jobs and creativity. This replacement would undermine the amount of respect given to people in their positions by their employer and potentially cause widespread displacement of workers in those areas. However, if companies see it as a recommendation to assist and not replace the people creating media, the use of this technology could lead to the creation of new jobs, an increase and boost to productivity, and avoid worker displacement.

  <span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">Recommendations</span>
</div>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of its ethical concerns, Generative Artificial Intelligence is here to stay. Policy makers should strive to alleviate some of these ethical concerns in various ways. 

* One recommendation to alleviate such concerns is making synthetic media transparent and explicit about how it was made or including some indication that it was made with the use of generative artificial intelligence.
* A second recommendation would be to have synthetic media require consent from the people whose likeness or content is being used in the media itself or to train the AI. 
* A third recommendation would be to increase public knowledge and recognition of synthetic media to combat the spread of disinformation in the general public. 
* A fourth recommendation would be to create and strengthen worker rights and protections that help make it so that this technology helps assist work and create new jobs rather wholly replace the workers. 
* A fifth and final recommendation would be to create more modern copyright laws that requires the consent of the original creators or people whose likeness is being used to create and train the AI,  provides them rights over how the AI can be used, and protects their work or likeness from being used in a harmful or devastating way.
