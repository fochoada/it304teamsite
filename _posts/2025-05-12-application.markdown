  <span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">History of AI</span>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout history, Artificial Intelligence(AI) has been defined in various ways, focusing on its features and technological advancements. Kurzweil (1990) mentioned that AI is the art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people, whereas Nilsson (1998) noted that AI is concerned with intelligent behavior in artifacts. These different approaches were differentiated as one group believed AI is a system that acts like a human. In contrast, another group believed AI is a system that combines both mathematics and engineering(Russell, S., & Norvig, P., 2003). However, today, we can see that both perspectives have been integrated to discover new AI-based technical advancements called Generative AI. Generative AI is an AI system that learns patterns from large datasets and creates an original output based on the learning. The primary applications of generative AI are AI image generation technology, such as Dall-E, Midjourney, and AI voice-replication technology, such as Resemble.AI and VocaliD. These real-world applications depict how AI continued to evolve into a powerful tool – both a boon and a curse, in reshaping human creativity and intelligence. 


<div style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">AI Models</span>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI image-generating models such as Dall-E and Midjourney create a realistic image using a text prompt. For example, if I instructed the tool by writing something like this, “An advanced architectural design of a modern house on top of a hill with an astonishing view,” then the realistic image with such keen details is provided. This advanced tool is beneficial when bringing highly creative and complex concepts to life, which could have taken days or weeks for an individual to make; however, the application also endures a few complexities and social challenges.


<div style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">Loss of Expression</span>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss of human expression and emotional depth—There’s an argument on the internet over how AI tools could negatively impact creative fields. An article by Aoki Studio, which reflects on a similar discussion, highlights that the art is fundamentally known to be an expression of human experience. Some forms of art, such as painting, graphic design, and product design, express their emotions or thoughts, their feelings, or some kind of message through their art; however, the images created by AI models miss that touch of human emotions and expressive richness. For example, the famous prehistoric Lascaux cave paintings in France depicted human life around 17,000 years ago. In contrast, the famous black and white painting “Guernica” by Picasso still gives chills to the viewers as it symbolizes the terror and horror of war.


<div style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">Copyright & Plagiarism</span>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An online campaign, #NoToAIArt, was seen over the internet as many artists expressed concerns about the legality of AI image generators. To create images from text prompts in tools like Midjourney and Dall-E, the AI generators must rely on a large database of existing art and illustrations from various artists who shared their work on the internet. As AI is a system that learns patterns from large datasets and creates output based on its learning, the realistic images created by various AI generators as of today, are all inspired by the original artists however the organizations that made these tools deny that they pirated intellectual property of countless artists even though many artists claim that those large datasets often include a lot of copyrighted images(Shaffi, 2023).


<div style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">Integrity</span>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss of integrity in the overall business—Woeller (2024) mentioned in her article on GoImagine that the use of AI-generated images in selling platforms or any commercial platforms without proper permissions and proper disclosure that this art was created by AI could potentially lead to accusations of copyright infringement and damage your business’s reputation and customers' trust. 


<div style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">Voice Replication</span>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, an AI-voice replication technology, also known as voice cloning, is an AI simulation capable of generating synthetic speech that resembles a targeted human voice. Technological advancements have made it difficult to differentiate between a real human voice and a fake automated voice. Such AI text-to-voice software has helped educational purposes by cloning the voices of historical figures for interactive teaching and realistic storytelling. IT has also helped narrate audiobooks and assist persons with speech disabilities; however, the applications have been noticed to be enduring a few complexities and social challenges(Martin,2022).


<div style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">Audio Deepfakes</span>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to rapid progress in voice cloning technology, audio deepfake cases are rising as criminals and hackers can communicate with their targets easily and anonymously and obtain their sensitive information(Lyons, 2020). Audio deepfakes are also used in pornography content to exploit their target’s image or defame them with poor intent. 


<div style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">Social Engineering and Scams</span>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, some news has been spreading regarding phishing and social engineering attempts via voice cloning software. Attackers or hackers usually use such tools to talk to their target in a voice of someone they trust, create a scenario where the other person is in desperate need - could be financial, or could be sensitive informations like their bank number, credit card information, company’s information, and ultimately trick them into their scam. In a few cases, voice cloning has been used to bully online and create fake evidence in criminal cases(Martin,2022).


<div style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;">Job Displacements</span>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies such as Respeecher and Sonantic create hyper-realistic voices that sound almost similar to a real human voice. With the use of deep-learning algorithm in learning voice patterns, pitch, timbre, and mimicking accents, tone, and emotions, these tools could create high-accuracy, which led several companies to choose AI tools, which was comparatively budget friendly and less time consuming, to support their business rather than voice actors, which led to their potential job displacement(Karunakaran, 2024).
